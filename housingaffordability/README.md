## Methodology

- **Lookback:** 20 years (7,300 days) to compute robust percentiles and grades.
- **Grading:** Percentile-based letter grades respect each indicator's interpretation (`higher_is_better`, `lower_is_better`, or `neutral`).
- **Trend/Changes:** Includes trend direction and multi-horizon percentage changes (1y/5y/10y/20y where applicable).
- **Resampling:** Uses adaptive resampling per frequency to store history compactly for downstream charting.

## Output Structure

- `_README`: Human-readable documentation (title, description, purposes, metric explanations, trading applications, notes).
- `metadata`: Generation timestamp, source, indicator list, lookback window, date range.
- `current`: Latest date, overall grade, per-indicator values, percentiles, grades, trends, change metrics, interpretations.
- `history`: Resampled historical series with `dates[]` and `values[]` per indicator.
